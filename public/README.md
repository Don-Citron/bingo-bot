This folder is updated automatically by the bot in order to provide up-to-date information that can be accessed elsewhere.

For example, you can send a request to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrSquirrelDeDuck/bingo-bot/main/public/stonk_history.json` to get the stonk history.

File list:
- stonk_history.json: The entire stonk history in a list.
- stonk_current.json: Just the current stonk values, the stonk tick number, and a link to the tick message.
